Project is based on the Real Time problem that Devaswom Board Temple's are facing in generating the Annual Report using current MySQL. 
The Reporting Tool will get the data from their existing RDBMS and will process in some of the above mentioned Big Data Tool. To deal with this issue various Big Data Tools like Python, Hadoop, Spark, Hive and Sqoop were tested and POC were created to compare the performance of each tool. Depending on the performance of each tool PySpark being fastest because of it's in-memory processing was choosen. Created a GUI using Python Tkinter to show the output. Involved in data processing and filtering using Numpy and Pandas package in Python.
